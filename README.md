### Hi there ðŸ‘‹ 

At my core, I'm a problem solver. That is best-shown in my work as a Web Developer, where the trial-and-error nature of coding allows for creative solutions to a wide range of problems. I'm proficient in JavaScript, HTML, CSS, and am learning more about back-end development every day in my Web Development course at CareerFoundry.  

In 2019, I graduated from Indiana University with a bachelor's degree in Journalism, as well as a Concentration in Informatics. Since then I have worked as a Page Designer and Page Design Supervisor on a variety of Colorado newspapers.
